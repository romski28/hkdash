# Hong Kong Air Quality Dashboard

A responsive, single-page dashboard that displays real-time air quality and weather data across Hong Kong districts. Built for clarity, transparency, and ease of use on any device.

### Why This Dashboard?

Most phone apps give you snapshots of weather or air quality in isolation.  
This dashboard unifies **air quality, pollutants, weather, humidity, and UV index** into one clear view, tailored to Hong Kong districts.  

- **Forecasting:** short‑term AQHI and pollutant trends help you plan your day.  
- **Transparency:** every reading is timestamped and sourced, so you know exactly when and where data comes from.  
- **Local relevance:** district‑level detail, not generic global feeds.  
- **Device‑agnostic:** works on any browser, no installs or logins required.  
- **Extendable:** can be personalised, extended, or connected to smart systems like AC, filters, and extractors.  

It’s not “just another app” — it’s a tool for clarity, context, and control.
